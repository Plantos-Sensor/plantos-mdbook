#  Introduction 
American Farming is deeply ingrained in our country's identity; a large driver in American population growth and land expansion, farming has established itself as a core industry in AMerican culture. Due to a combination of socio-economic disparities and agrarian policy, the barrier to entry for new farmers has become increasingly difficult. These difficulties to establish and maintain a profitable farm has led the farmining industry to consolidate land and profits unproportionately. The reduced competition in food supply chains has led to higher food prices for consumers.
