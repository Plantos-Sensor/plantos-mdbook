_Precision Agriculture Technology_, or PATs, are key to enabling our farmers with cost-effective and environmentally farming practices. Amongst growing populations, finite resources, and dwindling margins, implementing efficient farming practices have been more relevant than ever. Plantos Co-Op aims to provide small and medium sized agriculture operations with a better way of harnessing technology to farm.
