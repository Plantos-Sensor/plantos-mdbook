# Abstract
Plantos is a project with the goal of promoting healthy, sustainable, and low-cost options for food through an increase in the accessibility of permaculture. To lower the barrier to entry for sustainable urban farming, the Plantos Project will collect and analyze environmental and plant health data to provide end-users with easy-to-implement techniques for optimizing crop output. A successful implementation of Plantos will result in users capable of conducting a sow-to-harvest process of a crop with zero institutional knowledge of farming. Success of the project will be tested and measured through the amount of users obtained and crop yield results per a user.
