## Is Technology Threatening The Small Farm?
Precision Agriculture Technologies (PATs) are currently a catlyst to the growing disparity between large-scale farming operations and small to medium sized farms. While the agricultural industry is not a zero-sum game, large-scale farming practices clearly benefit from systematic advantages, widening the resource gap experienced by small to medium-sized farming operations. Due to high barriers to entry, such as costs and complexity of use, the benefits of PAT implementation have primarily been realized by large-scale farms. However, rapid advancements in hardware and artificial intelligence are enabling the creation of cost-efficient and user-friendly PAT tools. These developments have the potential to transform the current reality of farming, making these technologies more accessible to a broader range of agricultural operations.

## Demographics Tell the Story
Socio-demographic variables (i.e., age, gender, education, farming experience, income, and farm size) and their correlation with PAT adoption can help explain the current state of precision agriculture in small to medium-sized farms. Studies show that individuals most likely to adopt PATs are between 25-50 years old, have post-secondary education, extensive farming experience, and manage large acreages [[1]](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/15/2/177). Small-scale farmers are significantly underrepresented in this demographic compared to industrial farming operations. Examining the barriers to entry can help us understand how these demographic patterns emerged.

Cost, ease of use, reliability, power consumption, and signal range are the primary concerns affecting PAT adoption [[1]](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/15/2/177) [[2]](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/1/163). While these challenges are more manageable for high-frequency adopters, they present significant barriers for small-scale farmers looking to implement PATs.

## The Times They Are A-Changin'
Cost and ease-of-use were by far the greatest barriers to entry for small-scale farms implementing PATs. However, with rapid advancements in computing, hardware, and AI, these barriers are becoming obstacles of the past. The combination of low-cost remote sensors and machine learning offers an opportunity to drastically lower unit costs while maintaining data accuracy [[3]](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/14/9/1975). LoRa-enabled IoT devices allow for straightforward user interfaces and sensor pairing workflows, all while transferring high-throughput data over extended distances at minimal cost. These technological advances work together to lower the primary barriers to entry for PATs, enabling small-scale farms to leverage their advantages and remain competitive with large-scale operations.
