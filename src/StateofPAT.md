## Is Technology Threatening The Small Farm?
Precision Agriculture Technologies (PATs) are currently a catlyst to the growing disparity between large-scale farming operations and small to medium sized farms. While the agricultural industry is not a zero-sum game, large-scale farming practices clearly benefit from systematic advantages, widening the resource gap experienced by small to medium-sized farming operations. High barriers to entry, such as costs and complexity of use, result in the benefits of PAT implementation to be primarily realized by large-scale farms. The edge gained by utiliing PATs is compounding; resources saved from implementation one season can be reinvested into the crop and farming infrastructure the next season, allowing for an exponential increase in yield year after year. 

## Smallholder Farming = A Thriving Future
Ensuring the future of smallholder farming is synonymous with ensuring the future of food security, environmental stability, and wide-spread economic affluence. According to the USDA, small family farms are defined by gross cash farm income below $350,000 annually and make up about 89% of the population of farmers in the US [[4]](https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details?pubid=105387). These small family farms create food security and diversity through the variety of crops they generate, establishing agricultural biodiversity and reducing dependence on monocultures. In times of crop failure, diversity enhances food security by providing alternative non-effected crops. This diversity plays a role in environmental stability by cultivating soil health, supporting food-webs, and promoting pollination; in general, local farming practices are associated with taking better environmental stewardship over land. These smallholder farmers tend to employ and support local communities and their interests to a further extent than industrial farming.

Competition with large scale farming, cuts to government grants and subsidies, and rising expenses of resources and land are only a few of the factors preventing smallholder farmers from staying afloat. Just as we as a community cannot afford to let these farms fall behind the in the agricultural industry, smallholder farmers cannot afford to forgo PAT implementation. Rapid advancements in hardware and artificial intelligence are enabling the creation of cost-efficient and user-friendly PAT tools. These developments have the potential to transform the current reality of farming, making these technologies more accessible to a broader range of agricultural operations.

## Demographics Tell the Story
Smallholder farms demographically make up a huge portion of the agricultural landscape yet experience an asymetrical amount of crop productivity per area of land, the lack of PAT integration plays a significant factor in this statistical inbalance.

Socio-demographic variables (i.e., age, gender, education, farming experience, income, and farm size) and their correlation with PAT adoption can help explain the current state of precision agriculture in small to medium-sized farms. Studies show that individuals most likely to adopt PATs are between 25-50 years old, have post-secondary education, extensive farming experience, and manage large acreages [[1]](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/15/2/177). Small-scale farmers are significantly underrepresented in this demographic compared to industrial farming operations. Examining the barriers to entry can help us identify areas of improvement to increase PAT integration to small and medium sized farms.

The top 5 set-backs for smallholder farmers in deploying PATs are [[1]](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/15/2/177) [[2]](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/1/163):
1. Cost
2. Ease-of-use
3. Interoperability
4. Power consumption
5. Signal range

High costs present the greatest barrier to entry; driven by the novelness of technology and the need to purchase multiple units to achieve scale, the high prices are not perceived to be a favorable cost-reward tradeoff for smallholder farmers who are not in a position to take on additional input costs. Setup/onboarding, user interface, and data interpretation can result in a depletion of precious time and pointless frustration for the farmers who do decide to implement PATs. And the rapidly evolving nature of technology results in the accumilation of varying tech from different companies; the lack of operability between these different systems can render devices unusable even though they may merely be one or two generations old. Even with newer models, high powered systems force developers to choose between optimizing signal ranges, power source, and accurate sensing components, leaving room for inconsistency. All these factors, and more, deflate the urgency to integrate PATs into small to medium sized farms which result in a missed opportunity for these farms to improve resource managemnt, profits, sustaiability, and labor.

These challenges are more manageable for industrial farming because their risk tolerance is substantially greater than smallholder farms. Because of high costs, PATs realize their return quicker at scale; this makes the payoff less palpable for the local farmer. Farming by nature is a risk adverse industry and when external factors have made the idea of a thriving farm for smallholder farmers less and less obtainable, taking on the risk of new and expensive technology can seem ridiculous. 

## What's Changed?
Cost and ease-of-use were by far the greatest barriers to entry for small-scale farms implementing PATs. Rapid advancements in computing, hardware, and AI make existing obstacles a thing of the past. The combination of low-cost remote sensors and machine learning offers an opportunity to drastically lower unit costs while maintaining data accuracy [[3]](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/14/9/1975). LoRa-enabled IoT devices allow for straightforward user interfaces and sensor pairing workflows, all while transferring high-throughput data over extended distances at minimal cost. These technological advances work together to lower the primary barriers to entry for PATs, enabling small-scale farms to leverage their advantages and remain competitive with large-scale operations.
