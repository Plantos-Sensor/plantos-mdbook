## Is Technology Threatening The Small Farm?
Precision Agriculture Technologies (PATs) are currently a catlyst to the growing disparity between large-scale farming operations and small to medium sized farms. While the agricultural industry is not a zero-sum game, large-scale farming practices clearly benefit from systematic advantages, widening the resource gap experienced by small to medium-sized farming operations. Due to high barriers to entry, such as costs and complexity of use, the benefits of PAT implementation have primarily been realized by large-scale farms. However, rapid advancements in hardware and artificial intelligence are enabling the creation of cost-efficient and user-friendly PAT tools. These developments have the potential to transform the current reality of farming, making these technologies more accessible to a broader range of agricultural operations.

## Demographics Tell the Story
Socio-demographics variables (ie age, gender, education, experience of farming, income, and farm size) and their related liklihood of PAT adoption can be used to unravel the current state of PA in small to medium sized farms. Of the most likely indidividuals to adopt PATs, those who are 25-50 y/o, have a post-secondary education, many years of experience, and large acreage are the most frequent users [1](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/15/2/177). This demographic includes small scale farmers at a much lower rate than industry farming and we can look at the high barriers to entry to understand how these demographics were shaped.
