## The Winners and Losers of Ag Tech
Precision Agriculture Technologies (PATs) are currently a catlyst to the growing disparity between large-scale farming operations and small to medium sized farms. While the agricultural industry is not a zero-sum game, large-scale farming practices clearly benefit from systematic advantages, widening the resource gap experienced by small to medium-sized farming operations. Due to high barriers to entry, such as costs and complexity of use, the benefits of PAT implementation have primarily been realized by large-scale farms. However, rapid advancements in hardware and artificial intelligence are enabling the creation of cost-efficient and user-friendly PAT tools. These developments have the potential to transform the current reality of farming, making these technologies more accessible to a broader range of agricultural operations.

## Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?
Just as Paul Gauguin attempted to unravel the philosphical meaning of life with three primary questions in his painting, I'll attempt to answer the importance of precision agriculture through the lenses of the past, present, and future.
