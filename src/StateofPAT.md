## The Winners and Losers of Ag Tech
Precision Agriculture Technologies (PATs) are currently a catlyst to the growing disparity between large-scale farming operations and small to medium sized farms. While the agricultural industry is not a zero-sum game, large-scale farming practices clearly benefit from systematic advantages, widening the resource gap experienced by small to medium-sized farming operations. Due to high barriers to entry, such as costs and complexity of use, the benefits of PAT implementation have primarily been realized by large-scale farms. However, rapid advancements in hardware and artificial intelligence are enabling the creation of cost-efficient and user-friendly PAT tools. These developments have the potential to transform the current reality of farming, making these technologies more accessible to a broader range of agricultural operations.
