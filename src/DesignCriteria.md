# Design Criteria
The Plantos Project will be driven by a two-part prototype:
1. Product Package - Wireless sensor used to collect environmental data, connected to a mobile application that provides insights to plant health and care
2. Media Package - Documentary focused on the process of creating the sensor/app, explaining reasons of thought, struggles, success along the process.
